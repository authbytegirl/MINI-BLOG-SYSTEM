# Mini Blog 📝

A simple blogging platform built with **Spring Boot**, **Thymeleaf**, and **H2 Database**.  
Users can create, view, and delete blog posts in a clean and elegant interface.  

This project was created as part of my learning journey and also serves as a portfolio project.

## ✨ Features
- Create new blog posts with title, content, and author name  
- View a list of all blog posts  
- Read a single blog post in detail  
- Delete posts that are no longer needed  
- Persistent storage using H2 database (file-based)  
- Styled with a soft, yet professional color palette 🎀
